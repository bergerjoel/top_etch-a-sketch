# top_etch-a-sketch

This repository holds my current version of the [_EProject: Etch-a-Sketch_](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch), which is part of the [_Javascript Basics_](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#javascript-basics)course of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

## Description

The intent of this exercise was to start off with an almost barebone HTML file and only use Javascript DOM manipulation to build a reactive surface on which a user can "sketch" on when hovering over it.

Still to be done:

> 1. Rather than squares being the same color throughout the grid, randomize the squaresâ€™ RGB values with each interaction.
> 2. Implement a progressive darkening effect where each interaction darkens the square by 10%. The objective is to achieve a completely black square only ten interactions. (using CSS's `opacity`)
